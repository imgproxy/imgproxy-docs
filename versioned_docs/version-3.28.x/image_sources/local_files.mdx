# Serving local files

imgproxy can be configured to process files from your local filesystem. To use this feature, do the following:

1. Set `IMGPROXY_LOCAL_FILESYSTEM_ROOT` environment variable to your local images directory path.
2. Use `local:///path/to/image.jpg` as the source image URL.

:::tip
If filenames in your local filesystem may contain `?`, you may want to set [IMGPROXY_SOURCE_URL_QUERY_SEPARATOR](../configuration/options.mdx#IMGPROXY_SOURCE_URL_QUERY_SEPARATOR) to another string that is not used in filenames or set it to blank to disable query string extraction.

### Example

Assume you want to process an image that is stored locally at `/path/to/project/images/logos/imgproxy.png`. Run imgproxy with `IMGPROXY_LOCAL_FILESYSTEM_ROOT` set to your images directory:

```bash
IMGPROXY_LOCAL_FILESYSTEM_ROOT=/path/to/project/images imgproxy
```

Then, use the path inside this directory as the source URL:

```
local:///logos/imgproxy.png
```

The URL for resizing this image to fit 300x200 will look like this:

```imgproxy_url
http://imgproxy.example.com/insecure/rs:fit:300:200/plain/local:///logos/imgproxy.png@jpg
```
