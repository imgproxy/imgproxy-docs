# Getting an image info ((pro))

imgproxy can fetch and return a source image info without downloading the whole image: just send an HTTP `GET` request to the imgproxy's `/info` endpoint and imgproxy will respond with a `JSON` containing the image info.

The request URL path should consist of the `/info` prefix, a [signature](#signature), and a [source URL](#source-url), like this:

```imgproxy_url_template
http://imgproxy.example.com/info/%signature/plain/%source_url
http://imgproxy.example.com/info/%signature/%encoded_source_url
http://imgproxy.example.com/info/%signature/enc/%encrypted_source_url
```

## Signature

:::caution[Warning]
The signature part should always be present in a URL. If the signature check is disabled (no key/salt pairs are provided), the signature part may contain anything (for example, `unsafe` or `_`).
:::

A signature protects your URL from being modified by an attacker. It is highly recommended to sign imgproxy URLs in a production environment.

Once you set up your [URL signature](../configuration/options.mdx#url-signature), check out the [Signing the URL](./signing_url.mdx) guide to learn about how to sign your URLs. Otherwise, since the signature is required, feel free to use any string here.

## Source URL
### Plain

The source URL can be provided as is, prepended by `/plain/` part:

```imgproxy_url
/plain/http://example.com/images/curiosity.jpg
```

:::info
If the source URL contains a query string or `@`, you'll need to escape it.
:::

### Base64 encoded

The source URL can be encoded with URL-safe Base64. The encoded URL can be split with `/` as desired:

```imgproxy_url
/aHR0cDovL2V4YW1w/bGUuY29tL2ltYWdl/cy9jdXJpb3NpdHku/anBn
```

### Encrypted with AES-CBC

The source URL can be encrypted with the AES-CBC algorithm, prepended by the `/enc/` segment. The encrypted URL can be split with `/` as desired:

```imgproxy_url
/enc/jwV3wUD9r4VBIzgv/ang3Hbh0vPpcm5cc/VO5rHxzonpvZjppG/2VhDnX2aariBYegH/jlhw_-dqjXDMm4af/ZDU6y5sBog
```

## Response format

imgproxy responses with a JSON body and returns the following info:

* `format`: source image/video format. In case of video - list of predicted formats divided by comma
* `width`: image/video width
* `height`: image/video height
* `size`: file size. Can be zero if the image source doesn't set `Content-Length` header properly
* `exif`: Exif data
* `iptc`: IPTC data
* `xmp`: XMP data
* `photoshop`: Photoshop metadata (currently, only the resolution data)
* `video_meta`: metadata from the video

### Example (JPEG)
