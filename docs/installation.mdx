# Installation

There are four ways you can install imgproxy:

## Docker

imgproxy can (and this is highly recommended) be used as a standalone application inside a Docker container. Just pull the official image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull darthsim/imgproxy:latest
docker run -p 8080:8080 -it darthsim/imgproxy
```

You can also build your own image. imgproxy is ready to be dockerized out of the box:

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t imgproxy .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -it imgproxy
```

## Helm

imgproxy can be easily deployed to your Kubernetes cluster using Helm and our official Helm chart:

```bash
helm repo add imgproxy https://helm.imgproxy.net/

# With Helm 3
helm upgrade -i imgproxy imgproxy/imgproxy

# With Helm 2
helm upgrade -i --name imgproxy imgproxy/imgproxy
```

Check out the [chart's README](https://github.com/imgproxy/imgproxy-helm) for more info.

## Clouds

### Heroku

imgproxy can be deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) with the click of a button:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/imgproxy/imgproxy)

That being said, you can also do it manually in just a few steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imgproxy/imgproxy.git && cd imgproxy
heroku create your-application
heroku stack:set container
git push heroku master
```

If you want to deploy a specific version of imgproxy or imgproxy Pro, you can use [Heroku Container Registry](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime):

```bash
heroku create your-application
heroku stack:set container -a your-application
heroku container:login
# Replace "v3" with the imgproxy version you want to deploy
docker pull darthsim/imgproxy:v3-amd64
docker tag darthsim/imgproxy:v3-amd64 registry.heroku.com/your-application/web
docker push registry.heroku.com/your-application/web
heroku container:release your-application -a your-application
```

:::warning
Take a note that the example is using a tag suffixed with `-amd64` when pulling imgproxy Docker image. This suffix ensures that `docker pull` will download an image built for the `AMD64` CPU architecture which is used by Heroku.

If the machine where you're running these commands uses an `ARM64` CPU (such as Apple Silicone ones) and you don't use the `-amd64` suffix, `docker pull` will download an image built for the `ARM64` CPU architecture, and it won't be able to launch on Heroku.

### Dome

imgproxy can be deployed to [Dome](https://trydome.io/) with the click of a button:

## Packages

### Building Linux packages

We don't provide packages for imgproxy yet, but you can use the `imgproxy-build-package` script to export a DEB, RPM, or TAR package from a Docker image:

```bash
docker run -u0 --rm -it -v $(pwd):/dist darthsim/imgproxy:latest-amd64 imgproxy-build-package deb /dist
```

Where:
* `darthsim/imgproxy:latest-amd64` is the imgproxy Docker image you want to export the package from. Take note that we used the `-amd64` suffix in the image tag. This suffix ensures that the image built for the `AMD64` CPU architecture will be used. If you're using an `ARM64` CPU, you should replace the `-amd64` suffix with `-arm64`.
* `$(pwd)` is the directory on your host machine where the package will be saved. `$(pwd)` is a shell command that returns the current working directory. You can replace it with the path to the directory where you want to save the package.
* `deb` is the package format you want to export. You can replace it with `rpm` or `tar` to export an RPM or TAR package.

:::info
imgproxy binaries are linked against **libc 2.31** and **libstdc++ 10.2.1**, so you need to have these versions or newer on your system to run imgproxy. Here's a list of some Linux distributions that have these versions or newer:

* Ubuntu 20.04+ (Focal Fossa and newer)
* Debian 11+ (Bullseye and newer)
* Fedora 33+
* CentOS/RHEL 9+
:::

#### Installing a DEB package (Debian/Ubuntu)

You can install a DEB package on your Debian/Ubuntu system using the following command:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i imgproxy-3.25.0.arm64.deb
```

Where `imgproxy-3.25.0.arm64.deb` is the name of the DEB package you've exported.

If you don't have some of the required dependencies installed on your system, the installation process may fail. You fix the issue by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -f
```

This command will install the missing dependencies and finish the installation of the imgproxy package.

:::tip
The package contains an `/etc/imgproxy.rc` file that you can use to configure imgproxy by exporting required environment variables.
:::

#### Installing an RPM package (Fedora/CentOS/RHEL)

You can install an RPM package on your RHEL/Fedora/CentOS system using the following command:

```bash
sudo rpm -i imgproxy-3.25.0.arm64.rpm
```

Where `imgproxy-3.25.0.arm64.rpm` is the name of the RPM package you've exported.

If you don't have some of the required dependencies installed on your system, the installation process may fail. You need to install the missing dependencies manually.

:::tip
The package contains an `/etc/imgproxy.rc` file that you can use to configure imgproxy by exporting required environment variables.
:::

#### Installing a TAR package

You can extract the TAR package on your system using the following command:

```bash
tar -xzf imgproxy-3.25.0.arm64.tar.gz -C /opt
```

Where:
* `imgproxy-3.25.0.arm64.tar.gz` is the name of the TAR package you've exported.
* `/opt` is the directory where you want to extract the package. We'll refer to it as `%output_dir` from now on.

Use the `%output_dir/imgproxy/bin/imgproxy` script to run imgproxy. You can create a symlink to this script in the `/usr/local/bin` directory or add the `%output_dir/imgproxy/bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable to make the `imgproxy` command available system-wide.

:::tip
The package contains an `%output_dir/imgproxy/imgproxy.rc` file that you can use to configure imgproxy by exporting required environment variables.
:::

:::warning
Take care to not overwrite the existing `%output_dir/imgproxy/imgproxy.rc` file when updating imgproxy. If you've made any changes to the configuration, you should merge them manually.

### Arch Linux and derivatives

[imgproxy](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/imgproxy/) package is available from AUR.

### macOS + Homebrew

[imgproxy](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/imgproxy) is available from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```bash
brew install imgproxy
```

## From the source

:::warning
imgproxy depends on [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips) which has a lot of its own dependencies. We can't guarantee that the imgproxy dependencies installed in your system don't contain any bugs or vulnerabilities. We _highly_ recommend running imgproxy in a [Docker container](#docker) or using a [Linux package](#building-linux-packages) exported from a Docker image.
:::

You can get the imgproxy source code by cloning the GitHub repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imgproxy/imgproxy.git
cd imgproxy
```

...or by downloading the source tarball:

```bash
mkdir imgproxy
cd imgproxy
curl -Ls https://github.com/imgproxy/imgproxy/archive/master.tar.gz \
  | tar -xz --strip-components 1 -C .
```

You can also download a specific version:

```bash
mkdir imgproxy
cd imgproxy
curl -Ls https://github.com/imgproxy/imgproxy/archive/v3.20.0.tar.gz \
  | tar -xz --strip-components 1 -C .
```

### Ubuntu

First, install [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips). The easiest way is to use the apt package manager:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libvips-dev
```

However, the version of libvips in the Ubuntu repositories may be outdated, so you may want to build it from the source: [https://github.com/libvips/libvips/wiki/Build-for-Ubuntu](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/wiki/Build-for-Ubuntu)

Next, [install the latest version of Go](https://go.dev/doc/install).

And finally, install imgproxy itself:

```bash
CGO_LDFLAGS_ALLOW="-s|-w" \
  go build -o /usr/local/bin/imgproxy
```

### macOS + Homebrew

```bash
brew install vips go
PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$(brew --prefix libffi)/lib/pkgconfig" \
  CGO_LDFLAGS_ALLOW="-s|-w" \
  CGO_CFLAGS_ALLOW="-Xpreprocessor" \
  go build -o /usr/local/bin/imgproxy
```
